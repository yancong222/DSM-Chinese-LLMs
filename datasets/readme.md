- word associations in Chinese (https://aclanthology.org/2022.bucc-1.1.pdf), including three tasks:
    a) multiple choice (compare similarities between cues and the other three words, accuracy is the % of time the similarity between cue vector and first vector is the highest);
    b) correlation between cue-first similarity and the association score;
    c) retrieval task (measure similarities between each cue and all the other words in the task, and take the mean rank of the first associate words);
